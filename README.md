## ☑️About me
- My name is Cyrus, and I’m based in Lapu-Lapu City with my wife and kids—they inspire me to give my best every day. 

- Professionally, I specialize in Power BI, helping businesses streamline and automate their reporting processes. I handle end-to-end Power BI solutions, including understanding requirements, ETL, data modeling, dashboarding, testing and validation, and maintaining Power BI assets.

- Outside of work, I honestly enjoy catching up on sleep to recharge, but I always make sure to spend quality time with my family.

- I believe data is the new oil, and my goal is to keep growing in this field while using my experience to inspire others to embrace data as a driver of transformation.

At D&E Air Conditioning, I worked on projects like project tracking dashboards and revenue forecasting. I gathered requirements, standardized their data entry, and prepared data using Dataflows and Power Query, then built optimized data models, executive dashboards, and paginated reports. I was also responsible for workspace administration, security roles and user permissions.

Before D&E, I worked at Lexmark as a Finance Business Analyst, partnering closely with finance stakeholders to gather requirements and translate them into BI solutions using data from the business warehouse. I processed and modeled data, then delivered dashboards such as OPEX Analytics, Revenue Analytics, and Cost Center Analytics, providing a quick view of top cost and revenue drivers with drill-down analysis. This reduced manual effort and streamlined monthly reporting, allowing analysts to focus more on analysis and insights.

I worked part-time at AvantGuard, integrating data from IT operations and endpoint management tools like HaloPSA, NinjaOne, and Cove to build internal dashboards that monitored users and machines and enabled cross-validation across systems. I later worked with one of their clients to migrate from Excel-based reporting to Power BI, handling ETL, dimensional modeling, report and dashboard development, including paginated reports and executive dashboards like the Income Statement and P&L. This provided quick-glance insights and faster decision-making through executive summaries with drill-down analysis.

**Moderno Plant X**, Built near OEE dashboards to monitor machine performance and equipment utilization.

**At Excigence** |  Built a Python desktop application using Tkinter for the GUI and Pandas and Matplotlib for data preparation, analysis, and automated report generation for final testing of electronics and electrical devices.
