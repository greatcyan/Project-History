## ☑️About me
- My name is Cyrus, and I’m based in Lapu-Lapu City with my wife and kids—they inspire me to give my best every day. 

- Professionally, I specialize in Power BI, helping businesses streamline and automate their reporting processes. I handle end-to-end Power BI solutions, including understanding requirements, ETL, data modeling, dashboarding, testing and validation, and maintaining Power BI assets.

- Outside of work, I honestly enjoy catching up on sleep to recharge, but I always make sure to spend quality time with my family.

- I believe data is the new oil, and my goal is to keep growing in this field while using my experience to inspire others to embrace data as a driver of transformation.

Before D&E, I worked at Lexmark as a Finance Business Analyst. I partnered closely with finance stakeholders to gather business requirements and translate them into BI solutions for forecasting, budgeting, and performance reporting. I led multiple reporting projects, delivering dashboards for revenue, cost, OPEX, cost center analysis, extended warranty amortization, and worldwide expense bridging. I ensured data accuracy and governance and continuously optimized BI solutions to support evolving business needs.

I also worked part-time at AvantGuard, where I integrated data from IT and endpoint management applications such as Halopsa, NinjaOne, Cove, and others to build internal dashboards monitoring users, machines, and devices. Later, I delivered client-facing BI projects, performing ETL, dimensional modeling, and dashboard development to automate financial reporting and replace manual spreadsheets. This reduced manual effort, improved accuracy and scalability, and gave clients clearer operational and financial insights.
