## ☑️About myself
My name is **Cyrus Baruc**, I’m 34 years old, based in Lapu-Lapu City with my wife and kids.  
My family is my daily motivation—they inspire me and keep me grounded.

I worked as an **Electronics Technician** for more than ten years.  
During that time, I also explored **stock trading** and started learning **data analysis, data visualization, Python, and Excel**.  
Those experiences gave me both a strong analytical foundation and the perspective of a **business user**—understanding how data and charts connects to strategy and decision-making.  

That combination helped me transition into **data and business intelligence**.  
Today, I specialize in **Power BI**, focusing not only on building dashboards but also on **data processing, data modeling and ETL**, ensuring the data is clean, reliable, and delivers real business value.

Outside of work, I enjoy **journaling** to capture ideas that come to me during the day, and I make sure to spend quality time with my family.

My goal is to **inspire other professionals to see the power of data**.  
I believe **data is the new oil**—it fuels innovation, efficiency, and smarter decisions.  
I want to continue growing in this field and use my success as a way to encourage others to embrace data as a driver of transformation.

Before D&E, I worked at Lexmark as a Finance Business Analyst. I partnered closely with finance stakeholders to gather business requirements and translate them into BI solutions for forecasting, budgeting, and performance reporting. I led multiple reporting projects, delivering dashboards for revenue, cost, OPEX, cost center analysis, extended warranty amortization, and worldwide expense bridging. I ensured data accuracy and governance and continuously optimized BI solutions to support evolving business needs.

I also worked part-time at AvantGuard, where I integrated data from IT and endpoint management applications such as Halopsa, NinjaOne, Cove, and others to build internal dashboards monitoring users, machines, and devices. Later, I delivered client-facing BI projects, performing ETL, dimensional modeling, and dashboard development to automate financial reporting and replace manual spreadsheets. This reduced manual effort, improved accuracy and scalability, and gave clients clearer operational and financial insights.
